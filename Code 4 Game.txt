            { text: "B. Natural Gas", air: -1, forest: 0, temp: -1, feedback: "Natural gas is cleaner than coal, but still emits carbon dioxide. Your choice slightly worsened air quality and temperature, though not as severely as coal." },

            { text: "B. Build more highways", air: -1, forest: -1, temp: -2, feedback: "More roads mean more cars—and more pollution. Air quality has dropped, and the added traffic is heating things up." },

The crop helps capture carbon in the air, lowering the nearby temperature and provides food for the nearby villages." },

Increase agriculture throughout the country and shipping to the villages", air: -2, forest: -2, temp: -1, feedback: "More agriculture increases carbon emissions and requires more land to be cleared for farming. The villages also depend on goods to be shipped in from other farms throughout the country further increasing carbon emissions." },

Promote water conservation and rainwater harvesting", air: 1, forest: 0, temp: 0, feedback: "Promoting water conservation and rainwater harvesting are two great ways to not drain your water supply.
